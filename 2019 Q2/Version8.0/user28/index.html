    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Well, maybe not the world quite yet, but maybe one day. Anyways, hello. Welcome to my webpage that I had to build from scratch. It was quite fun, and very confusing, and definitely frustrating. But, in the end, the work payed off and I think everything turned out exactly how I wanted it.</p>
    <center><h2>My Themes</h2></center>
    <br>
    
    
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>I have 3 themes for this website, one being music. I love music. It can be calming but also make you feel energetic and I think that's cool.</p>
<br>
    <br>
    <br>
<br>
    <h3>Pop-Tarts</h3>
    <p>Another theme for my website was Pop-Tarts. They are my favorite breakfast food and strawberry is the best flavor.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Arcade Games</h3>
    <p>My final theme is arcade games. Hence why there is Pacman. I love Pacman, Galaga, Centipede, etc. They're all super cool.</p>
