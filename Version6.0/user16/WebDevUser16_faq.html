	<dt>How long have you played piano?</dt>
	<dd>11 years. I started in the summer of 2008.</dd>
	<dt>How do I practice more?</dt>
	<dd>I'm sure you've been told to log your practice hours or set aside a specific time slot to practice, and while those practices do help, it really comes down to personal enjoyment. Pick songs you WANT to learn.</dd>
	<dt>How long should I practice?</dt>
	<dd>It depends. For beginners, I recommend anywhere from 25 to 30 minutes. As for more advanced students, I'd suggest 1 to 2 hours (with breaks).</dd>
	<dt>What should I practice?</dt>
	<dd>Scales. For the love of God, Blease practice your scales. If you are unwilling to practice anything else, practice your scales.</dd>
	<dt>What is the hardest part of playing piano?</dt>
	<dd>The hardest part of piano, I believe, is interpretation. Different musical eras require nuances that can make or break a song. And the worst part? It's not something you can learn directly from a book.</dd>
